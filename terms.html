            Welcome to Linus. It's awesome to have you here with us.<br>
            These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Linus app, website, and services provided by Linus
            Labs Pty Ltd ("we", "our", or "us"). By using Linus, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-intro">
            We've done our best to keep this human, readable, and actor-first, while still covering the important stuff.

            <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Linus is built by actors, for actors. We exist to support your creative process with our responsive,
                emotionally intelligent rehearsal partner; always ready, always in flow. Whether you're prepping for a
                major production or running lines solo, Linus helps you rehearse with ease, presence, and confidence.
            </p>

            <p>Our mission is simple: to help actors deliver performances that move the world.</p>

            <p>We exist so actors can spend time doing what they love with the people that they love. By designing
                actor-first tools that are intuitive, adaptive, and powered by play. We provide a platform where actors
                can rehearse, explore and prepare anytime, anywhere. And we hope to see you thrive by using our
                platform.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>4. Billing & Cancellation</h2>
            <h3>App Store Billing:</h3>
            <p>All payments are handled via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>

            <h3>Manage Subscriptions:</h3>
            <p>You're responsible for managing your pass or subscription via your app store account.</p>

            <h2>5. Scripts, Voices & Usage Rights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Work Is Yours:</strong> You own any content (scripts, recordings) you upload or create.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Limited License:</strong> You give us permission to process your content to make Linus work
                    (e.g., formatting scripts, generating cues). This is temporary and solely for app functionality.
                </li>
                <li><strong>No Training or Ads:</strong> We don't use your content to train unrelated AI or sell it to
                    third parties.</li>

                <h3>Voice Licensing</h3>
                <p>All voices in Linus are AI models built from real actor voices, created with full consent and fairly
                    licensed for rehearsal use only. Every actor whose voice powers Linus has been ethically engaged and
                    appropriately compensated. We've worked closely with them and trusted partners like ElevenLabs to
                    make sure the experience feels real, responsible, and actor-first. These voices are not for copying,
                    exporting, or using outside the Linus app.</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Extraction:</strong> You may not download, clone, or use AI voices outside Linus.</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Use:</strong> Don't misuse Linus or the voices for harm, misinformation, or outside
                    commercial use.</li>
            </ul>

                    basic usage data).</li>

            <h2>7. Feedback & Suggestions</h2>
            <p>We love hearing from you, but if you share ideas or feedback:</p>
            <p>You allow us to use, improve upon, or build on those ideas, feature requests, or feedback, whether
                solicited or not, you grant us the unrestricted right to use it to improve Linus without compensation or
                obligation.</p>

            <p>This does not apply to your creative work, just product ideas, features, or enhancements.</p>

            <p>We're not obligated to implement suggestions, but we still value every one, and once again, you won't be
                compensated or credited unless agreed to in writing.</p>

            </ul>

            <p>Enjoy Linus, use it to rehearse. But don't try to or replicate it in any way. Play a cyber criminal, but

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>9. Tech Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Linus is powered by advanced AI, but no tech is perfect. It may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tech Happens:</strong> There may be glitches, misreads or downtime.</li>
                <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> Linus is here to support your rehearsal, but we can't promise
                    outcomes (booking roles and delivering performance is out of our control)</li>
                <li><strong>"As Is" Service:</strong> Linus is provided "as is," with no guarantees beyond what the law
                    requires.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Not Responsible For:</h3>
            <p>Lost auditions, unexpected crashes (we're working tirelessly to avoid this!), issues caused by your
                device, connection, or third party platforms.</p>

            <h3>Indemnity:</h3>
            <p>If your direct misuse of Linus gets us into legal trouble, you agree to cover our costs.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We'll do our best to notify you of major changes (via email or in-app)</li>
                <li>That said, it's your responsibility to stay up to date.</li>

            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia, unless your local consumer laws say
                otherwise.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We aim to resolve disputes informally first.</li>
                <li>If a formal dispute arises, it will be handled in NSW courts unless your local law requires
                    otherwise.</li>
                <li>If any part of these Terms is invalid, the rest still apply.</li>
                <li>These Terms and our Privacy Policy form the full agreement between you and Linus.</li>
