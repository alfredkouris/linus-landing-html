        <p class="legal-intro">
            Your privacy matters to us. This policy outlines what we collect, why we collect it, and how we handle your
            information.
            We want you to be able to focus on your performance knowing your data is protected.
        </p>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Email Address</h3>
            <p>We collect your email when you sign up for Linus. We use it to manage your account, communicate with you
                (like sending updates or support responses), and personalise your experience.</p>

            <h3>Device Information</h3>
            <p>We collect basic device data (such as device type and operating system version) to ensure Linus works
                properly on your phone or tablet.</p>

            <h3>Optional Interaction Data</h3>
            <p>We collect anonymous data about how you interact with Linus's AI (for example, timing of cues or
                playback). We use this optional data to improve Linus's performance and make your rehearsal partner
                smarter. This data does not include your actual script content or personal details. You can opt out of
                this at any time via the Linus app.</p>

            <div class="legal-highlight">
                <h3>No Script Content Storage</h3>
                <p>We do not collect or store the scripts or scene content you upload or rehearse. Your creative work
                    stays private to you and on your device.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Payment Information</h3>
            <p>We do not handle your payment details directly. Purchases and subscriptions are processed securely
                through third-party platforms (such as the Apple App or Google Play store). Linus itself never sees or
                stores your card or payment details.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>2. Infrastructure and Analytics</h2>

            <h3>Supabase</h3>
            <p>Linus uses Supabase for backend infrastructure, user authentication, and analytics. This helps us
                monitor performance (like crash reports), maintain reliability, and deploy new features seamlessly.</p>

            <h3>Analytics SDKs & Usage Data</h3>
            <p>We may use additional tools (such as Meta SDK, Google Analytics for Firebase, or similar SDKs) to
                understand how Linus is used. This data includes in-app behaviors, crash logs, feature usage, and
                anonymized interaction patterns. These tools help us improve the experience and make Linus smarter and
                more useful over time.</p>

            <p>This may include first-party and third-party cookies or SDK tracking, depending on the platform or
                version of Linus you're using.</p>

            <p>All collected data is either anonymized or aggregated. We do not sell this data, and we use it
                exclusively to improve performance, fix bugs, and enhance your rehearsal experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>3. Push Notifications and Marketing</h2>
            <p>Linus may occasionally send you push notifications or emails to help you get the most out of the app
                (e.g., new features, rehearsal tips, actor-related updates). We only do this if you've opted in.</p>

            <p>You can opt out at any time via in-app settings or the unsubscribe link in our emails.</p>

            <p>We also track basic email engagement (such as open rates or clicks) using pixels, so we can understand
                what communication is helpful. This helps us keep messages relevant, and not spammy.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>4. Voice Technology and AI Ethics</h2>
            <p>All character voices in Linus are AI-generated clones of real actors' voices, used with their full
                consent. Each actor is compensated and retains an interest in how their voice is used.</p>

            <p>These voices are licensed for use only within the Linus app for personal rehearsals only. They are not to
                be used commercially or externally.</p>

            <p>We do not sell, share, or rent these voice models to anyone else. They exist strictly to help you
                rehearse in Linus, and we protect them accordingly.</p>

            <p>When we use third-party AI services to understand your scripts and deliver responses (for example, for
                voice processing via ElevenLabs or text understanding via cloud AI providers), we only send the minimum
                data needed for the feature. These providers are obligated to handle your data securely and only for
                providing the experience of Linus.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>5. Device Access and Permissions</h2>
            <p>To provide core functionality, Linus may request access to certain features on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> for recording your lines or enabling voice interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> to upload scripts, save audio or selftape recordings.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> only if you use the self-tape feature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We only request access when needed. You can manage permissions in your device settings. Disabling access
                may limit some features.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>6. Cookies and Website Tracking</h2>
            <p>While our app doesn't use traditional browser cookies, we may use tracking technologies to better
                understand user journey within the app, on our website or in regards to our emails to better understand
                usage and improve our services.</p>

            <p>These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Analytics on our website to track visits and improve site performance</li>
                <li>Email pixels to understand whether our messages are useful</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These tools help us understand things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which features or pages are most useful</li>
                <li>How users interact with the app</li>
                <li>Whether an email was opened or clicked through</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data is anonymised or aggregated. We do not sell this data.</p>

            <p>If you prefer not to be tracked, you can disable cookies in your browser or opt out using tools provided
                by platforms like Google or Meta.</p>

            <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosures</h2>
            <p>We respect your privacy and handle your data with care. We do not sell your personal data and will only
                share limited data in these cases:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> Like our cloud partners, to help us provide the Linus
                    service. They only get what they need and are contractually required to protect your data.</li>
                <li><strong>If Required by Law:</strong> Such as in response to a legal request, court order, or to
                    protect safety or legal rights.</li>
                <li><strong>If Linus is Acquired:</strong> Your data may transfer to the new owner. If this happens,
                    we'll ensure your data is still protected, or ask for your consent if required.</li>
                <li><strong>If You Violate Terms:</strong> If someone uses Linus for unlawful activity (like uploading
                    copyrighted material), we may act to protect other users and our community. Which could include
                    removing the content or disabling the user's account, in accordance with our Terms of Service.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>8. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
            <p>We store your data as long as needed to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operate Linus</li>
                <li>Provide support</li>
                <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you delete your account, we delete or anonymize your data. Some info may persist briefly in backups.
            </p>

            <p>Your data may be stored in secure servers located in countries such as the U.S., Europe, or Australia.
                Wherever it's stored, we apply the same security standards and comply with data transfer regulations
                (e.g. GDPR Standard Contractual Clauses).</p>

            <p>Linus is designed for users 13 and older. Users between 13–17 must use Linus with parental consent or
                supervision.</p>

            <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13. If we discover we have, we will delete it
                promptly. If you believe a child under 13 has used Linus, please contact us immediately.</p>

            <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your data. Linus uses industry-standard security measures to safeguard
                your information:</p>

            <h3>Encrypted data transfers</h3>
            <p>Data you provide to Linus is transmitted over secure (encrypted) connections.</p>

            <h3>Secure servers and backups</h3>
            <p>We store data in secure cloud environments that implement strong security practices (like firewalls,
                encryption at rest, and regular security audits).</p>

            <h3>Role-based access control</h3>
            <p>Our team members are trained on privacy and security, and only authorised personnel can access personal
                data, and even then, only what they need to do their jobs.</p>

            <h3>Ongoing security monitoring</h3>
            <p>No system is 100% secure, but if there's ever a breach that affects your data, we'll notify you and the
                relevant authorities quickly, as required.</p>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy as Linus evolves or legal standards change. If we make major changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We'll post the updated policy here</li>
                <li>We'll notify you via email or in-app</li>
            </ul>

                and delete your account.</p>
